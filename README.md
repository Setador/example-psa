# example-psa
Single page application (SPA) is a web application that fits on a single page. All your code (JS, HTML, CSS) is retrieved with a single page load. And navigation between pages performed without refreshing the whole page.

Pros
No page refresh
SPA feels like a native application: fast and responsive.
Ability to work offline

Cons
More complex to build
SPA needs to download more resources when you open it.
Client should have javascript enabled
Of course, SPA requires javascript. But fortunately, almost everyone has javascript enabled.
